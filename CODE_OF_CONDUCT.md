## Risks and assumptions
- Assumptions: Maintainers can enforce the standards consistently.
- Risks / blast radius: Harassment or exclusion can harm contributors.
- Rollback / recovery: Remove or suspend access for violators.

## Prerequisites
- Required: A private channel for reporting conduct issues (configure this)
- Optional: A public incident response summary process

## Quickstart
### 1) Follow the standards
- Be respectful and constructive.
- Assume good intent and ask clarifying questions.
- Keep discussions focused on the work.

### 2) Report issues privately
Use the private reporting channel defined by the maintainer (configure this).

### 3) Verify
Expected output:
- Reports are acknowledged and handled promptly.

## Common tasks
### Report a conduct issue
- What you get: A safe path to escalation.
- Steps:
```sh
# Contact the configured maintainer channel privately.
```
- Verify: Maintainer confirms receipt.

### Request moderation
- What you get: A review of problematic behavior.
- Steps:
```sh
# Provide a summary, links, and screenshots if relevant.
```
- Verify: Maintainer documents the decision.

## Troubleshooting
### Symptom: No response to a report
Cause: No reporting channel is configured.
Fix: Define a private contact and update this file.

### Symptom: Repeat bad behavior
Cause: Inconsistent enforcement.
Fix: Apply consistent consequences and document them.

### Symptom: Unclear expectations
Cause: Standards are too vague.
Fix: Add concrete examples to this file.
